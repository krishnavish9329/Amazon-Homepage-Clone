# What do you know about Amazon?

Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos in Bellevue, Washington. The company originally started as an online marketplace for books but gradually expanded its offerings to include a wide range of product categories. This diversification led to it being referred to as "The Everything Store".
